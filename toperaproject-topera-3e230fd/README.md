# What's Topera?

Topera is a new security tools for IPv6, with the particularity that their attacks can't be detected by Snort.

Snort is the most known IDS/IPS and is widely used in many different critical environments. Some commercial tools (Juniper or Checkpoint ones) use it as detection engine also.

Mocking snort detection capabilities could suppose a high risk in some cases.

All the community is invited to test it in any environment and we would be thankful if you send us any feedback.

This tool was presented in the second edition of the [Security Conference "Navaja Negra"](http://www.navajanegra.com) by Daniel Garcia a.k.a cr0hn ([@ggdaniel](https://twitter.com/ggdaniel/)) and Rafa Sanchez ([@r_a_ff_a_e_ll_o](https://twitter.com/R_a_ff_a_e_ll_o)).

# What's new?

* Slow HTTP attacks (Slowloris over IPv6).
* Improved TCP port scanner.


# Why?

Our intention is to promote awareness of and show the security implications of IPv6.
